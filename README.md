`src/numerical_models.py` implements Monte Carlo surveys for (A) twin binary,
varying planet populations, and for (B) fixed planet radius, varying binary
mass ratio populations. The routine behind this is explained in more depth in
`monte_carlo_readme.md`

`src/integrate_for_apparent_rate_density.py` integrates the general equation
for apparent rate density. The output from this code is then processed to
make the presented figures.
