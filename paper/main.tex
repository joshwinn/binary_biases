Wide-field surveys for transiting planets, such as the NASA {\it Kepler}
and {\it TESS} missions, are usually conducted without knowing which stars
are actually binaries. Unresolved and unrecognized binary stars give rise to 
systematic errors in planet occurrence rates, including misclassified planets 
and miscounts in the number of searched stars. The individual errors can have 
different signs, making it difficult to anticipate the net effect on planet 
occurrence rates. Here we use simplified models of signal-to-noise limited 
transit surveys to try and clarify the situation. We derive a formula for the 
apparent occurrence rate density measured by an observer who falsely assumes 
all stars are single. The formula depends on the binary fraction; the 
mass function of the secondary stars; and the true occurrence of planets 
around primaries, secondaries, and single stars. It also takes into account 
the Malmquist bias by which binaries are over-represented in flux-limited 
samples. Application of the formula to an idealized {\it Kepler}-like survey 
shows that for planets larger than $2r_\oplus$, the net systematic error is of 
order 10\%. For smaller planets the errors are potentially larger: the 
occurrence of Earth-sized planets could be overestimated by as much as a 
factor of two. One consequence is that unrecognized binaries cannot account 
for the apparent discrepancy between the hot Jupiter occurrence rates measured 
by transit and RV surveys. We also show that if high-resolution imaging 
reveals a transit host star to be a binary, the planet is usually more likely 
to orbit the primary star than the secondary star.

\section{Introduction}

One of the goals of exoplanetary science is to establish how common,
or rare, are planets of various types.  Knowledge of planet occurrence
rates is helpful for inspiring and testing theories of planet
formation, designing the next generation of planet-finding surveys,
and simply satisfying our curiosity about other worlds.  One method
for measuring occurrence rates is to monitor the brightnesses of many
stars over a wide field, seeking evidence for planetary transits.
Measuring occurrence rates using this method was the highest priority
of the NASA {\it Kepler} mission.  Great strides have been made in the
analysis of {\it Kepler} data, including progress toward the goal of
determining the fraction of Sun-like stars that harbor Earth-like
planets~\citep{
  youdin_exoplanet_2011,petigura_prevalence_2013,dong_fast_2013,
  foreman-mackey_exoplanet_2014,burke_terrestrial_2015}

A lingering concern in occurrence rate studies is that in most cases,
investigators have assumed that all of the sources of light that were
monitored are single stars~\citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{
  howard_planet_2012,fressin_false_2013,foreman-mackey_exoplanet_2014,
  dressing_occurrence_2015,burke_terrestrial_2015}. In reality many of
them are unresolved multiple-star systems, especially binaries.
Unrecognized binaries cause numerous systematic errors in the
planetary occurrence rates.  For example, when there is a transiting
planet around a star in a binary, the additive constant light from the
second star reduces the fractional loss of light due to the planet.
This ``flux dilution'' makes transit signals harder to detect and
lowers the number of detections.  On the other hand, in a binary there
two opportunities to detect transiting planets, which could increase
the overall number of detections.

At the outset of this study it was not clear to us whether the neglect
of binaries was a serious issue at all, or even whether the net effect
of all the errors is positive or negative.  The goal of this study was
to clarify the various sources of error and provide a framework for
dealing with these issues.  In this spirit, most of our models are
idealized and analytic, and we do not attempt a detailed correction of
the results from {\it Kepler} or any other real transit survey.
However we can estimate the order of magnitude of the effects,
assuming the survey is signal-to-noise limited and given a model for
the true planet occurrence rate.

This paper is organized as follows.  The next section enumerates the
various errors that arise from unrecognized binaries.  Then, in
Section~\ref{sec:simplest}, we develop an idealized model of a transit
survey in which all planets have identical properties, and all stars
are identical except that some fraction are in binary systems.  This
simple model motivates the derivation of a general formula, given in
Section~\ref{sec:general_formula}, that allows for more realistic
stellar and planetary populations.  We use this formula in
Section~\ref{sec:more_complicated} to explore more complicated but
nevertheless still analytic models.  In Section~\ref{sec:discussion}
we discuss the errors due to unrecognized binaries for some specific
cases of current interest: the occurrence of Earth-like planets; the
apparent discrepancy between hot-Jupiter occurrence rates in different
surveys; and the shape of the ``evaporation valley'' in the radius
distribution of planets that was brought to light by
\citet{fulton_california-_2017}.  We review all the results in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.


\section{Understanding the errors}
\label{sec:concept}

Imagine a group of astronomers that wants to measure the mean number of
planets of a certain type per star of a certain type.  They perform a
wide-field photometric search for planets that transit, and discover
all for which
\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta_{\rm obs}}{\sigma}
  = ({\rm constant}) \cdot \delta_{\rm obs} L_{\rm sys}^{1/2} d^{-1}
> \left(\frac{{\rm S}}{{\rm N}}\right)_{\rm min}.
\label{eq:S_N_thresh}
\end{equation}
Here the signal S is the observed transit depth $\delta_{\rm obs}$, in
units of relative flux.
%LB: we don't introduce r or R because they are system-specific.
%For single stars, $\delta_{\rm obs} \approx (r/R)^2$; for binaries,
%flux dilution $\mathcal{D}$ lowers the observed depth to
%$\delta_{\rm obs} \approx \mathcal{D} (r/R)^2$. 
The noise N is the uncertainty in the
determination of the flux ratio of the star inside and outside of
transits.  Throughout this paper we will assume the photometric
uncertainty to scale as the inverse square root of the number of
photons collected from the source, {\it i.e.}, the dependence on
stellar properties is $\sigma \propto (L_{\rm sys}/d^2)^{-1/2}$, where
$L_{\rm sys}$ is the luminosity of the stellar system and $d$ is its
distance from Earth.
% The solid angle coverage, telescope area, and
% survey duration are in the ``constant'' term of
% Equation~\ref{eq:S_N_thresh}.  The transit duration also affects
% detectability, but we omit it in this work for brevity.

The astronomers then assume that all stars are single.  In particular
they do not have accurate enough parallaxes to tell that some of the
stars are apparently overluminous. 
They want to compute the number of planets with size $r$ per star of mass $M$.
If the total number of such stars for which the planets could be detected
($N_\star$) and the number of detected planets ($N_{\rm det}$) are both 
large, then the astronomers' estimate for the occurrence rate ($\Lambda$) is 
simply
\begin{equation}
\Lambda(r,M) = \frac{N_{\rm det}(r,M)}{N_\star(r,M)}
                    \times \frac{1}{p_{\rm tra}(r,M)},
\label{eq:occ_rate_simple}
\end{equation}
where $p_{\rm tra}$ is the geometric transit probability, needed to
account for the fact that most planetary orbits are not aligned close
enough with our line of sight to produce transits.

There are many potential pitfalls in this calculation.  Some genuine
transit signals are missed even if they formally exceed the
signal-to-noise threshold, because of the probabilistic nature of
transit detection.  Planets can be misclassified due to statistical
and systematic errors in the catalogued properties of the stars.  Some
apparent transit signals are spurious, arising from noise fluctuations
or failures of ``detrending'' the astrophysical or instrumental
variations in the photometric signal.  Poor angular resolution leads
to blends between eclipsing binary stars and other stars along nearly
the same line of sight, producing signals that mimic those of
transiting planets.

We will focus exclusively on the subset of problems that arise from
the fact that many stars exist in gravitationally bound binary
systems.  Even with this narrow focus, there are numerous sources of
error.  All three of the quantities in
Equation~\ref{eq:occ_rate_simple} are subject to
observational bias:
\begin{enumerate}
%    
    \item The number of detections, $N_{\det}$, is actually the number of 
    detected planets that {\it appear} to have size $r$, orbiting stars that 
    {\it appear} to have mass $M$.
    Whenever the planet-hosting star is part of a binary,
%    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the planet's size will be misclassified because of the reduction
        in the amplitude of the photometric signal;
%        
        \item the host star's properties could be misclassified because its 
        light is combined with a second star of a different spectral type.
%        
    \end{itemize}
%    
    \item The apparent number of stars that were searched, $N_\star$,
    is biased
%    
    \begin{itemize}
%        
        \item toward lower values, because it does not include all of the
        secondary stars that were searched for transiting planets.
%        
        \item toward higher values, because some of the stars that
        appeared to be suitably small and bright to detect the desired
        type of planet are in fact binaries for which the amplitude of
        the photometric signal would be reduced to an undetectable
        level.
%        
    \end{itemize}
%    
    \item The transit probability $p_{\rm tra}$, which scales with the
    stellar mean density as $\rho^{-1/3}$, is biased because the
    planet-hosting star could be misclassified.
%    
\end{enumerate}

Two other problems that may arise are not represented in
Equation~\ref{eq:occ_rate_simple}.  One is astrophysical:
the true occurrence rate of the desired type of planet may depend on
whether the host is a single star, the primary star of a binary, or
the secondary star of a binary.  Such differences could be caused by
the requirement for long-term dynamical stability, or differences in
the planet formation process.  When the search sample includes both
singles and binaries, the detected planets are thereby drawn from
different occurrence distributions~\citep[see,
{\it e.g.},][]{wang_occurrence_2015}.

The other problem is an observational effect.  Even after the
astronomers learn about binaries and attempt to correct for their
presence, they must realize that the ratio of binaries to single stars
in the sample will differ from that in a volume-limited sample due to
a type of Malmquist bias.  Binaries have a higher total luminosity
than either the primary or secondary star would have on its own.  This
means that the binaries are searchable for transit signals of a given
amplitude at greater distances from the Earth.  The binaries in a
sample of apparently searchable stars are therefore drawn from a
larger search volume than the single stars.


% JNW: Let's remember, when discussing Kepler, to point out that it's
% not really a SNR or flux limited survey, because of the
% preselection. This would need to be dealt with in a realistic
% treatment.

% JNW: Let's also remember to say somewhere that we do not deal with
% period distributions none of these effects mess up the period.

Planet occurrence rates are often presented as two-dimensional density
functions in the space of planet radius and orbital period.
Thankfully none of the errors we have enumerated lead to errors in the
period distribution.  When more than one transit is detected (as is
usually required by the surveyors), the orbital periods can be
measured without ambiguity regardless of whether the host star is
single or one member of a binary.  Hence in what follows, we focus on
the radius distribution and assume the periods are measured without
significant uncertainty.

Given all of the confusing and opposing sources of error, we will
proceed in stages. We will start from a barebones model in which
everything can be written down on the back of a napkin, and build up
to an analytic model allowing for generality in the distribution of
the binaries and the planets they host.  We consider only the
corrections to the occurrence as a function of planetary radius, and
not the orbital period (the other key variable in transit studies),
because when multiple transits are detected the period can be directly
measured regardless of whether the host star is single or part of a
binary.

\section{Simple models}
\label{sec:simplest}

\subsection{One type of star, one type of planet}
\label{sec:model_1}

Since the effects of binarity are most pronounced when the two
components are similar, we begin by considering a universe in which
all stars are identical, with mass $M$, radius $R$, and luminosity
$L$.  Some fraction of them exist in twin binaries.
All planets have size $r\p$.
Our goal is to compare the occurrence inferred by observers who
ignore binarity with the true occurrence in single star systems.

To clarify our terminology, we define ``apparent properties'' as the 
properties that one would infer about a system under the assumption that the 
host star is single. For instance, the  ``apparent planet radius'', $r\a$, is
the planet radius that one would infer from a transit signal, 
assuming that the host star is single.
The observed transit depth is given by the ratio of the apparent planet
radius and the apparent stellar radius, $R\a$:
\begin{equation}
\delta_{\rm obs}
= \left(\frac{r\a}{R\a}\right)^2
= \left[{r\over R_{\rm host}}\right]^2\times {L_{\rm host} \over L_{\rm 
        sys}},
\label{eq:delta_obs_general} 
\end{equation}
for $r$ the planet radius, $R_{\rm host}$ ($L_{\rm host}$) the 
host star's radius (luminosity), and $L_{\rm sys}$ the 
entire system's luminosity.
In the example at hand, $R_{\rm host} =R\a = R$, since all stars have the same 
size. For single star systems we have $r=r\a=r\p$. In twin binaries, 
$r\a=r\p/\sqrt{2}$, since $L_{\rm sys}=2L$.

We can now understand that the observers are unwittingly
reporting an {\it apparent} occurrence rate $\Lambda\a(r\a)$ as
a function of apparent radius.
The apparent occurrence rate is the same as the {\it true} occurrence rate for 
transit signals of 
amplitude $\delta_{\rm obs} = (r\a/R\a)^2$, \textit{i.e.}, the number of 
detections ($N_{\rm det}$) of signals of amplitude $\delta_{\rm obs}$, divided 
by the number of sources $N_\star$ from which such a signal could be detected.

Finally, it is helpful to introduce an apparent rate density 
$\Gamma\a$, the average number of planets per star per unit apparent planet 
radius. Analogous to Equation~\ref{eq:occ_rate_simple},  
\begin{equation}
\Gamma\a(r\a) = \frac{n_{\rm det}(r\a)}{N_\star(r\a)}
\times \frac{1}{p_{\rm tra}(r\a)},
\label{eq:apparent_rate_density}
\end{equation}
where $n_{\rm det}={\rm d}N_{\rm det}/{\rm d}r\a$ is the number  
of detected planets, per unit $r\a$, with apparent radius $r\a$.
In Equation~\ref{eq:apparent_rate_density}, we neglect the dependence on 
stellar mass since all stars in this model have the same properties.

To compute the number of detected planets, we consider the volumes within 
which a given signal could be detected. At a fixed signal-to-noise floor, 
there is a maximum searchable 
distance~\citep{pepper_using_2003,pepper_searching_2005}.
From Equation~\ref{eq:S_N_thresh}, this maximum searchable distance scales as
\begin{equation}
d \propto \delta_{\rm obs} \cdot L_{\rm 
    sys}^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
Assuming that stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number 
of searchable stars $N_\star$ is then proportional to
\begin{equation}
N_\star \propto n \delta_{\rm obs}^3 L_{\rm 
    sys}^{3/2},
\label{eq:N_searchable_prop}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number per unit volume of {\it e.g.}, single star, or binary 
systems.
We neglect the dependence of $n$ on stellar type.

    \end{center}
    \caption{
        Searchable volumes for single stars ({\it left}) and 
        twin binaries ({\it right}), assuming that all stars have the 
        same mass, radius, and luminosity, and that all planets have the same 
        radius $r=r\p$.
        {\it Top:} At an apparent radius $r\a=r\p$,
        the observer searched twin binaries out to a
        distance $\sqrt{2}\times$ that of single stars.
        Because of dilution, there are no planets in twin binaries with 
        $r\a=r\p$.
        {\it Middle:} At $r\a=r\p/\sqrt{2}$, the 
        maximum searchable distances are half those at $r\a=r\p$. 
        The only detected planets with $r\a=r\p/\sqrt{2}$ orbit twin binaries.
        {\it Bottom:} Planets with a true radius $r=r\p$ are searchable to 
        a maximum distance $d_0$ around singles, and $d_0/\sqrt{2}$ around 
        twin binaries.
    }
    \label{fig:model_1_volumes}
\end{figure}

The searchable volumes for this example are illustrated in 
Figure~\ref{fig:model_1_volumes}.
At an apparent radius equal to the true radius ($r\a=r\p$), single stars 
with $d<d_0$ are searchable.
Binaries with $r\a=r\p$ are also searchable, out to $\sqrt{2}d_0$. 
However, in this example no such systems exist; all planets in twin binaries 
have true radii $r=r\p$, and so are observed with apparent radii 
$r\a=r\p/\sqrt{2}$, out to $d_0/\sqrt{2}$.
At an apparent radius of $r\a=r\p/\sqrt{2}$, there could also be planets with 
true radii $r=r\p/\sqrt{2}$ orbiting singles, but there are no such systems 
in this model.

How many planets are detected?
If we assume that there are $N_\star^0(r\a)$ singles that are searchable for 
planets with $r\a$, and that there are $Z_0$ planets per single, then 
single stars contribute
\begin{equation}
n_{\rm det}^0(r\a) = N_\star^0(r\a) Z_0 p_{\rm tra} \cdot \delta(r\a - r_p)
\end{equation}
planet detections (per unit $r\a$), for $\delta$ the Dirac delta function.

We can similarly compute the number of planet detections from binaries.
First though, we define a ratio $\mu \equiv N_\star^{\rm b}(r\a) / 
N_\star^0(r\a)$ 
between the number of searchable binary systems and the number of searchable 
singles at any $r\a$.
This quantity is useful because although $N_\star^{\rm b}$ and $N_\star^0$ vary
as a function of the observed transit depth, $\mu$ remains fixed.
Applying this definition, at $r\a=r\p/\sqrt{2}$, some detections will come 
from primaries,
\begin{equation}
n_{\rm det}^1(r\a) =
\mu N_\star^0(r\a) Z_1 p_{\rm tra}
\cdot \delta\left(r\a - \frac{r\p}{\sqrt{2}}\right),
\end{equation}
and some from secondaries,
\begin{equation}
n_{\rm det}^2(r\a) = 
\mu N_\star^0(r\a) Z_2 p_{\rm tra}
\cdot \delta\left(r\a - \frac{r\p}{\sqrt{2}}\right),
\end{equation}
where $Z_1$ is the number of planets per primary, $Z_2$ is the number of 
planets per secondary, and $p_{\rm tra}$ is the same for identical stars.
For twin binaries, Equation~\ref{eq:N_searchable_prop} gives $\mu = 
2^{3/2} n_{\rm b}/n_{\rm s}$, where $n_{\rm b}$ is the number density of 
binaries in a volume-limited sample.

The last item we need to write down the apparent rate density $\Gamma\a(r\a)$ 
is the number of unresolved point-sources on sky that the observer thinks are 
searchable, $N_\star$.
From the definition of $\mu$,
\begin{equation}
N_\star(r\a) = N_\star^0(r\a) \times (1 + \mu)
\label{eq:apparentlysearchable_to_searchable}
\end{equation}
relates the number of apparently searchable point-sources to the number of 
searchable singles.
From the discussion above, it should be clear that there are in fact
$N_\star^0(r\a)\times (1 + 2\mu)$ searchable stars at any given $r\a$; the 
observers are under-counting.

Using Equation~\ref{eq:apparent_rate_density}, the apparent rate density 
computed when ignoring binarity is
\begin{align}
\Gamma\a(r\a) = 
\frac{1}{1+\mu} Z_0 \cdot
\delta(r\a-r\p)  +
\frac{\mu}{1+\mu} (Z_1 + Z_2) \cdot
\delta\left(r\a-\frac{r\p}{\sqrt{2}} \right).
\label{eq:model_1_apparent_rate_density}
\end{align}
The number of searchable singles at a given apparent radius, 
$N_\star^0(r\a)$, makes no appearance.
The observer has erred in Equation~\ref{eq:model_1_apparent_rate_density} by 
under-counting the number of searchable stars at any apparent radius, and by
inferring incorrect planet radii in binary systems.

\begin{figure}[!tb]

    \caption{
        Apparent occurrence rate $\Lambda\a$, and occurrence rate for singles 
        $\Lambda_0$, for a model with one type of star, one type of planet, 
        and twin binaries (same as Figure~\ref{fig:model_1_volumes}).
        We assume a twin binary fraction of $0.1$, and that
        single, primary, and secondary stars host planets at equal 
        rates.
        If the true planet radius is $r\p$, all planets detected in binaries 
        will have apparent radii $r\a = r\p/\sqrt{2}$;
        Equation~\ref{eq:model_1_apparent_rate_density} gives the 
        normalizations.
    }
    \label{fig:occ_rate_model_1}
\end{figure}

To assess the severity of these errors, we must assume both a binary fraction, 
and also the true number of planets per single, primary, and secondary star 
($Z_0,Z_1,Z_2$).
For the former,~\citet{raghavan_survey_2010} found a multiplicity 
fraction of 0.44 for primaries with masses from $0.7M_\odot$ to $1.3M_\odot$.
By multiplicity fraction, they meant ``fraction of systems in a volume-limited 
sample that are multiple'', which we simplistically take to be fraction of 
systems in a volume-limited sample that are binaries:
\begin{equation}
{\rm binary\ fraction} \equiv \frac{n\b}{n\s + n\b} = 0.44,
\end{equation}
Of course not all of these are binaries are close to being ``twin'' binaries 
as we have assumed in our simple calculation.
Perhaps only a tenth of them have pairs of stars close enough
in their basic properties to produce errors as significant as those
we have been considering.  Thus, an appropriate estimate
for the binary fraction is of order $0.05$.
The ratio of the apparent to single star rate densities,
\begin{equation}
X_\Gamma(r) \equiv \left. \frac{\Gamma\a(r\a)}{\Gamma_0(r)} \right|_{r\a 
    \rightarrow r},
\end{equation}
can then be thought of as a ``correction factor''.
At the true planet radius, $X_\Gamma(r\p)=1/(1+\mu)$.
This yields a correction $X_\Gamma$ of 0.87~(0.76) if the binary fraction is 
0.05~(0.10).
All together the various effects produce biases of order 10\% in the
occurrence rates.  We will see that this level of error is characteristic
of many of our more complicated models, as well.

An alternative assumption is that secondaries do not host planets. In that 
case, the correction to the rate density at the true planet radius becomes 
$X_\Gamma(r\p) = (1+2\mu)/(1+\mu)^2$.
This gives a correction of 0.98~(0.94) if the binary fraction is 0.05~(0.10).
Although the secondaries certainly should have planets, 
the fact that $\Gamma\a/\Gamma_0$ is sensitive to the relative number 
of planets per single, primary, and secondary will also become
important as we proceed.

\subsection{One type of star, two types of planets}

A simple extension to the previous example helps distinguish 
between the apparent and underlying planet populations.
Consider now a universe that is the same as that of 
Section~\ref{sec:model_1}, except that half of planets have radii $r\p$, 
while the other half have radii $r\p/\sqrt{2}$.
The rate densities are
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_i(r) = \frac{Z_i}{2} \left[
\delta(r-r\p) + \delta\left(r-\frac{r\p}{\sqrt{2}}\right)
\right], \quad {\rm for}\  i \in \{ 0,1,2 \},
\end{equation}
where as before $i=0$ corresponds to singles, $i=1$ to primaries, and $i=2$ to 
secondaries, and the $Z_i$'s are the number of planets per star of each type.

Following an identical line of reasoning as in Section~\ref{sec:model_1}, the 
apparent rate density can be written
\begin{align}
\notag
\Gamma\a(r\a) &=
\frac{1}{2(1+\mu)} \left[
Z_0 \cdot \delta(r\a - r\p)
+
\left[Z_0 + \mu (Z_1 + Z_2)
\right] \cdot \delta\left(r\a - \frac{r\p}{\sqrt{2}}\right) 
\right. \\
&\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad+
\left.
\mu(Z_1 + Z_2) \cdot \delta\left(r\a - \frac{r\p}{2}\right)
\right].
\label{eq:two_radii_twins}
\end{align}
There are now three different sizes of detected planets.
The important qualitative point is that at $r\a = 
r\p/\sqrt{2}$, two populations contribute.
The first population is singles with $r=r\p/\sqrt{2}$, and the second is twin 
binaries with $r=r\p$.
Both populations are detected out to the same maximum searchable distance.
Just as with Equation~\ref{eq:apparentlysearchable_to_searchable}, we benefit 
from a cancellation of $N_\star^0(r\a)$ terms, leaving only the $\mu$ weights.
Generally, at any given apparent radius, there will be contributions
from both single, primaries, and secondaries~---~but the relative weights
between these contributions will depend on the underlying occurrence rates.

\section{General formula for apparent occurrence rate}
\label{sec:general_formula}

To generalize the procedure of Section~\ref{sec:simplest}, we consider an 
SNR-limited transit survey in which the singles and primaries can have 
arbitrary properties, but their true masses are known by the observer.
We assume that there are some functions $L(M)$ and $R(M)$ that specify a 
star's luminosity and radius in terms of its mass, and that the volume-limited 
binary mass ratio distribution, $f(q)$, is independent of the primary's mass.
We also allow arbitrary true rate densities for singles, primaries, 
and secondaries ($\Gamma_0, \Gamma_1, \Gamma_2$).
We presume that the observers always take the properties of a binary system to 
be those of the primary.

Given this laundry-list of assumptions, a general formula for the apparent 
rate density follows:
\begin{align}
\notag
\Gamma\a(r\a,M\a) &= {1\over 1+\mu(\mathrm{BF}, M\a)}\times
\left\{ \Gamma_0(r\a, M\a)+ 
\frac{{\rm BF}}{1 - {\rm BF}}
\left[ \int_0^1 \mathrm{d}q \,
       \frac{f(q)}{\mathcal{A}^3}\cdot
       \frac{1}{\mathcal{A}} \Gamma_1\left({r\a\over \mathcal{A}}, 
M\a\right)\,
\right.   
\right. \\
& \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \left.\left.
+\int_0^1 {\rm d}q\, \frac{f(q)}{\mathcal{A}^3}\cdot \frac{q}{\mathcal{B}}
    \Gamma_2\left({r\a\over \mathcal{B}}, qM\a\right)\cdot
{R(qM\a) \over R(M\a)}
q^{-1/3} \right]	\right\},
\label{eq:general_Gamma_a}
\end{align}
where ${\rm BF}=n\b/(n\s+n\b)$ is the volume-limited binary fraction, 
and $\mathcal{A}(q,M\a)$ [$\mathcal{B}(q,M\a)$] are the dilution terms for 
primaries [secondaries], whose functional dependences are omitted for 
notational simplicity.
The dilution terms can be written
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A}(q, M\a)=\sqrt{L(M\a) \over L_{\rm sys}(M\a, q)}
= (1+q^\alpha)^{-1/2},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}(q, M\a)={R(M\a)\over R(qM\a)}\sqrt{{L(qM\a) \over L_{\rm 
            sys}(M\a, q)} }
= q^{-1} (1+q^{-\alpha})^{-1/2}
\end{equation}
where the latter equalities assume $L\propto M^\alpha \propto R^\alpha$ (the 
former are more general).
The rate densities depend on both apparent radius and mass 
because even if the primaries and singles were to have fixed
mass, the mass of secondaries would vary, and so this dependence cannot be 
immediately omitted.


A derivation of Equation~\ref{eq:general_Gamma_a} is given in the 
\hyperref[sec:appendix]{Appendix}; its qualitative features are as follows.
The terms inside the curly braces $\{ \ldots \}$ are the sum of 
the apparent rate densities from singles, primaries, and secondaries.
The contribution from singles is not affected by binarity.
In the contributions from primaries and secondaries,
planets with $(r\a, M\a)$ are associated with 
systems of different planetary and stellar properties, as determined
by the mass ratio $q$ of each binary.
This corresponds to true planet radii and stellar masses 
$(r\a/\mathcal{A},M\a)$ for primaries, and $(r\a/\mathcal{B},qM\a)$ for 
secondaries.
These contributions are then integrated over the mass ratio distribution 
including the effect of Malmquist bias, $f(q)/\mathcal{A}^3$, discussed 
further below. Finally, the latter term in the apparent rate density of 
secondaries comes from a correction for the overestimated transit probability.


\paragraph{Ratio of searchable binaries to singles}
We must also specify the exact form of $\mu$, the ratio of 
the number of searchable binary systems to singles.
Given the observed signal $\delta_{\rm obs}$ and apparent stellar mass $M\a$, 
recall that the maximum searchable distance for singles and binaries are 
proportional to $\delta_{\rm obs}\cdot L(M\a)^{1/2}$ and $\delta_{\rm 
obs}\cdot [L(M\a)+L(qM\a)]^{1/2}$.
Applying Equation~\ref{eq:N_searchable_prop},
\begin{equation}
\mu({\rm BF},M\a) = 
\frac{N_\star^{\rm b}(r\a)}{N_s^0(r\a)}=
\int_0^1 {n_{\rm b}\over n_{\rm s}}\left[1+{L(qM\a) \over L(M\a)}\right]^{3/2} 
f(q)\,\mathrm{d}q.
\label{eq:mu_general}
\end{equation}
If the binary fraction is independent of $q$, $L \propto M^\alpha$, and $f(q) 
\propto q^\beta$, this simplifies to
\begin{equation}
\mu =\frac{{\rm BF}}{1 - {\rm BF}}\cdot {1\over{1+\beta}}\int_0^1 
\left(1+q^\alpha\right)^{3/2} q^\beta \,\mathrm{d}q.
\label{eq:mu_power_laws}
\end{equation}
%which can also be rewritten using the hypergeometric function.
\begin{figure}[!tb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/mass_ratio_distribution.pdf}
    \caption{
        The mass ratio distribution for a magnitude-limited sample of 
        binary stars, in which the underlying volume-limited distribution is 
        uniform, qualitatively similar to
        Figure~16 of \citet{raghavan_survey_2010}.
        At a given observed transit depth, the searchable binaries in a 
        transit survey are magnitude-limited.
    }
    \label{fig:q_distribn_mag_limited}
\end{figure}
This can be understood as a Malmquist bias: at fixed observed transit 
depth, for singles and primaries with the same luminosity, binaries are 
searchable to a greater distance;
In particular, the sample of searchable binaries is magnitude-limited.
Given a searchable binary, the probability that it has a mass ratio $q$ 
scales as
\begin{equation}
p({\rm draw\ }q\,|\,{\rm system\ is\ binary}) \propto 
(1+q^\alpha)^{3/2} q^\beta 
\label{eq:Malmquist_bias}
\end{equation}
where $q^\beta$ is the volume-limited probability of drawing a binary of mass 
ratio $q$, and the first term is the Malmquist bias when $L\propto M^\alpha$.
We show this magnitude-limited mass ratio distribution for the $\beta=0$ case 
in Figure~\ref{fig:q_distribn_mag_limited}.
In Monte Carlo simulations of transit surveys, it is 
important to draw binaries from a correctly biased mass-ratio distribution 
\citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{bakos_hatsouth:_2013,sullivan_transiting_2015,
    gunther_new_2017}.

\section{Realistic Star and Planet Distributions}
\label{sec:more_complicated}
We now apply our general equation for the apparent rate 
density (Equation~\ref{eq:general_Gamma_a}) to study binarity's effects in 
regimes of observational interest.
In what follows, we will write the rate density for each type of star, 
$\Gamma_i(r)$, as the product of a shape function and a constant:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_i(r) = Z_i f_i(r), \quad {\rm for\ }i\in\{0,1,2\},
\end{equation}
where $i=0$ corresponds to single stars, $i=1$ to primaries of 
binaries, and $i=2$ to secondaries of binaries.
The shape function is normalized to unity.
The $Z_i$'s are each system type's occurrence rate $\Lambda_i$, integrated 
over all planetary radii. In other words, they are number of planets per 
single, primary, or secondary star.
We want to consider the effects of varying not only $f_i(r)$ but also the
relative values of the $Z_i$'s.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Power law planet radius distributions}
\label{sec:model_2}

\subsubsection{Twin binaries}
We begin introducing realism by keeping all binaries as twins, but letting the 
planet radius distributions vary.
First, we assume a power law,
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_i(r) = Z_i f(r) = Z_i r^\delta/\mathcal{N}_r,
\end{equation}
for $f(r)$ the radius shape function, and $\mathcal{N}_r$ the shape function's 
normalization.
The resulting apparent rate density is 
\begin{equation}
\Gamma\a(r\a) = \frac{r\a^\delta}{\mathcal{N}_r} \left[
\frac{Z_0}{1+\mu}
+
2^{\frac{\delta+1}{2} } \frac{\mu}{1+\mu} \left(Z_1 + Z_2
\right)
\right],
\label{eq:model5_apparent_rate_density}
\end{equation}
which is quite similar to the twin binary, fixed-planet case 
(Equation~\ref{eq:model_1_apparent_rate_density}), 
except that the radius dependence and normalization are different.
As in Section~\ref{sec:model_1}, $\mu = 2^{3/2} n\b/n\s$.
If the $Z_i$'s are equal, the ``correction factor'' relative to the rate 
density for singles becomes quite simple:
\begin{align}
\left. \frac{\Gamma\a(r\a)}{\Gamma_0(r)} 
\right|_{r\a\rightarrow r}
&=
\frac{1 + 2^{\frac{\delta+3}{2}}\mu}{1 + \mu}.
\label{eq:power_law_correction}
\end{align}
If the binary fraction is $0.1$, $\mu\approx 0.15$. Taking $\delta=-2.92$ from 
\citet{howard_planet_2012},  we get a correction factor $\Gamma\a/\Gamma_0 = 
1.004$.
In other words, the apparent rate density is an {\it over}estimate compared to 
the rate density of single stars, with a relative difference $\delta \Gamma_0 
= |\Gamma_0 - \Gamma\a | / \Gamma_0$ of 0.4\%.
This is quite a small effect!
Clearly though, it cannot apply at small radii, since $f(r) \propto r^\delta$ 
diverges; \citet{howard_planet_2012}'s 
results indicate that the power law planet radius distribution holds for 
$r\a\gtrsim 2r_\oplus$.
It is similarly nonsensical for $f(r)$ to be finite above some upper radius 
limit $r_{\rm u}$, perhaps around $\approx 24r_\oplus$, based on the most 
inflated hot Jupiters.
An upper cut-off of $r_{\rm u}$ would lead to smaller values of $\Gamma(r\a)$ 
down to $r_{\rm u}/\sqrt{2}$, compared to an intrinsic power law without the 
cut-off.
We are not particularly interested in this effect because there are better 
models for hot Jupiter occurrence rates that we will discuss in 
Section~\ref{sec:further_models}.
If the assumptions behind this model are at all applicable to real transit 
surveys, Equation~\ref{eq:power_law_correction} suggests that for $2r_\oplus 
\lesssim r\a \lesssim 17r_\oplus$, binarity's impact on apparent occurrence 
rates is quite small.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Binaries with power law mass ratio distribution}
\label{sub:powerlaw_varying_binaries}

To check whether non-twin binaries change the preceding result, we now assume 
$f(q) = q^\beta/\mathcal{N}_q$, for $\mathcal{N}_q$ the normalization.
This changes $\mu$ (Equation~\ref{eq:mu_general} simplifies to 
Equation~\ref{eq:mu_power_laws}).
It may also affect the rate density, which could be a function of the 
varying stellar mass.
Absorbing this dependence into a power law as well,
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_i(r,M) = Z_i \times \frac{r^\delta}{\mathcal{N}_r} \times
\frac{M^\gamma}{\mathcal{N}_M},
\end{equation}
where $Z_i$ is dimensionless, and the normalization constants carry 
the units (each side has units $[r^{-1} M^{-1}]$).
We assume that stars are a one-parameter family, given by $R \propto M \propto 
L^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}$, so that a given value of $q$ determines everything 
about a secondary.

We are mostly interested in the apparent rate density's radius dependence.
Marginalizing Equation~\ref{eq:general_Gamma_a} over apparent stellar mass, we 
find
that when $Z_0=Z_1=Z_2$,
\begin{align}
X_\Gamma &\equiv \left. \frac{\Gamma\a(r\a)}{\Gamma_0(r)} 
\right|_{r\a\rightarrow r} \\
&=
\notag
\frac{1}{1+\mu}
\left[1 + \frac{1}{\mathcal{N}_q} \frac{n\b}{n\s}\times 
\left(
\int_0^1 {\rm d}q\,q^\beta (1+q^\alpha)^{\frac{\delta+4}{2}} +
\right.
\right. \\
&\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad
\left.\left.
\int_0^1 {\rm d}q\,q^{\beta+\delta+\frac{5}{3}} 
(1+q^\alpha)^{\frac{3}{2}}
(1+q^{-\alpha})^{\frac{\delta+1}{2}}
\right)\right],
\label{eq:powerlaw_vary_binary}
\end{align}
where $\gamma$ does not appear because of the marginalization over $M\a$.
For $\alpha = 3.5$, $\beta=0$, $\gamma=0$, $\delta=-2.92$, the 
summed integrals in Equation~\ref{eq:powerlaw_vary_binary} give 
$(\ldots)\approx 
1.50249$. %171211_model_integrals.nb
For $n\b / (n\b + n\s)=0.44$, this yields $\Gamma\a/\Gamma_0 = 1.048$; the
relative difference between the apparent rate density and the rate density 
around singles is 4.8\%.
This indicates that considering only twin binaries gave us correct 
intuition: for a power law radius distribution 
($2r_\oplus \lesssim r\a \lesssim 17r_\oplus$) in which there are the same 
number of planets orbiting singles, primaries, and secondaries, binarity 
influences apparent planet occurrence rates around Sun-like stars at the 
$\sim$few percent level.

\subsection{Varying stars; broken power law planet radius distribution}
\label{sec:model_3}

\begin{figure}[!t]
    \centering
    \epsscale{1.15}
    \plottwo{figures/int_rate_density_vs_radius_model_3_rpu_22.5_manyZs.pdf}{figures/int_occ_rate_vs_radius_model_3_rpu_22.5_manyZs.pdf}
    \caption{
        {\it Left:} apparent rate density ($\Gamma\a$) and single star rate 
        density ($\Gamma_0$). {\it Right:} apparent occurrence rate 
        ($\Lambda\a$) and single star occurrence rate ($\Lambda_0$), over 
        $0.5r_\oplus$ bins.
        The true planet radius distribution is specified by 
        Equation~\ref{eq:model3_radius_distribution}. 
        This model assumes that the observer knows the true properties of all 
        the singles and primaries, and that the volume-limited mass 
        ratios of secondaries are drawn from a uniform distribution. Further, 
        we take $Z_0=Z_1=0.5$ throughout; $Z_0,Z_1,Z_2$ are the number of 
        planets per single, primary, and secondary star.
        The rate and rate density are related by $\Lambda|_a^b 
        = \int_{a}^{b}\Gamma\,{\rm d}r$.
    }
    \label{fig:occ_rate_model_3_log}
\end{figure}

Though the details of the planet radius distribution $\Gamma_i(r)$ at 
$r<2r_\oplus$ are currently an active topic of research, we can consider how 
binarity affects this regime under different plausible assumptions.
For instance, assume that the true radius shape function is
\begin{align}
f(r)
&\propto
\left.
\begin{cases}
r^\delta & \text{for } r\geq 2r_\oplus \\
{\rm constant} & \text{for } r\leq2r_\oplus.
\end{cases}
\right.
\label{eq:model3_radius_distribution}
\end{align}
As in the previous model, we presume that the observers know the true 
properties of all singles and primaries. The masses, radii, 
and luminosities of stars vary as $R \propto M \propto L^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}$.
Our ``nominal model'' remains the same: 
$\alpha=3.5$, $\beta=\gamma=0$, $\delta=-2.92$.

At apparent radii $r\a > 2r_\oplus$, the results of this model are the same as 
those from Section~\ref{sub:powerlaw_varying_binaries}.
For $r\a < 2r_\oplus$, the equations are tedious, but still tractable.
For simplicity, we insert Equation~\ref{eq:model3_radius_distribution} into 
Equation~\ref{eq:general_Gamma_a}, and integrate using a computer 
program. We refer the interested reader to our online 
implementation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/lgbouma/binary_biases}}.
The output is validated against analytic predictions in the $r\a > 
2r_\oplus$ and the $r\a < 2r_\oplus/\sqrt{2}$ regimes, and is plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:occ_rate_model_3_log}.


\paragraph{The rate of Earth analogs}
The immediately arresting result there is a ``bump'' in the apparent rate 
density at $r\a < 2r_\oplus$: the true rate for singles is less than the 
inferred rate.
For the case in which secondaries host as many (half as many) planets as 
single stars, this means an overestimate of the absolute occurrence rate by 
$\approx 50\%$ ($\approx 25\%$).
The ``bump'' exists even for the $Z_2/Z_0=0$ case as a $\approx 10\%$ effect.
Evidently, the magnitude of this error depends strongly on the prevalence of 
planets around secondaries.

\paragraph{Hot Jupiter occurrence rates}
Taking Figure~\ref{fig:occ_rate_model_3_log} and integrating the rate density, 
we can compare the apparent hot Jupiter 
occurrence rate with the true rate for singles.
In the most extreme case of $Z_2/Z_0=0$, we find that $\Lambda_{{\rm 
HJ},0}/\Lambda_{\rm HJ,a} = 1.13$, where
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_{\rm HJ,a} = \int_{8r_\oplus}^{\infty} \Gamma\a(r)\,{\rm d}r,
\end{equation}
and similarly for $\Lambda_{\rm HJ,0}$.
%occ_rate_vs_radius_model_3_withtext_Zsub2_0.00_rpu_22.5.pdf
If $Z_2/Z_0>0$, binarity affects the apparent hot Jupiter rate less: when 
$Z_2/Z_0=0.5$, we find $\Lambda_{{\rm HJ},0}/\Lambda_{\rm HJ,a} = 1.06$.

\paragraph{Fraction of detected planets from a given source}

\begin{figure}[!t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/ndet_vs_radius_logx_model_3_fraclines_rpu_22.5_manyZs.pdf}
    \caption{
        Fraction of detected planet at a given apparent planet radius coming 
        from singles (solid lines), primaries (dashed lines), and secondaries 
        (dotted lines).
        Three different values for $Z_2/Z_0$ are selected: $1$ (blue), $0.5$ 
        (orange), $0$ (green).
        The assumed true planet radius distribution is a broken power law
        (Equation~\ref{eq:model3_radius_distribution}; same as 
        Figure~\ref{fig:occ_rate_model_3_log}).
    }
    \label{fig:frac_model_3}
\end{figure}

It would be nice to improve our intuition for how much the secondaries matter.
We have the understanding that for a given true planet radius, secondaries 
have a much smaller searchable volume than primaries or singles.
Does this necessarily imply that if we are given a detected planet with some 
apparent radius $r\a$, which is then observed by high-resolution imaging to 
exist in a binary, that the planet probably orbits the primary?

We explore this quantitatively in Figure~\ref{fig:frac_model_3}.
The lines in this figure are computed using the expressions given in the 
appendix for the number of detections coming from singles, primaries, and 
secondaries (Eqs.~\ref{eq:n_det_0},~\ref{eq:n_det_1}, and~\ref{eq:n_det_2}).

In short, the detected planet usually is more likely to orbit the primary, but 
it depends on the number of planets orbiting secondaries, and also on the 
apparent radius of the detected planet.
In the scenario that high-resolution imaging finds a system with $r\a > 
2r_\oplus$ in a binary, roughly $\sim\! 2.5\times$ more detected planets orbit 
primaries than secondaries, for the $Z_2/Z_0=1$ case.
For the $Z_2/Z_0=0.5$ case, $\sim\! 5\times$ more detected 
planets orbit primaries than secondaries.
So detected planets in binaries with large apparent radii (relative to the 
cutoff in the intrinsic rate density) are more likely to orbit the primary.

The situation for $r\a < 2r_\oplus$ is more nuanced.
For the $Z_2=0$ and $Z_2/Z_0=0.5$ cases, detected planets in binaries are 
still always more likely to orbit the primary.
However, if there are as many planets orbiting the secondaries as the 
primaries, then there is a turn-over radius, $\approx 0.4r_\oplus$, 
beyond which more of the detected planets in binaries come from secondaries: 
they have all been ``diluted down'' from larger true planetary radii!
Although this (apparent) radius is at the limit of current detection 
sensitivities, this effect will be interesting for future instruments to 
investigate.

Further, Figure~\ref{fig:frac_model_3} shows that going from apparent 
radii of $2r_\oplus$ to $\approx 1.4r_\oplus$, the fraction of detected 
planets with binary companions increases by $\approx 6-12\%$, depending on the 
assumed value of $Z_2/Z_0$.
Let the fraction of total detected planets from primaries at a given 
apparent radius be $F_1(r\a)$, so $F_1(r\a) \equiv n_{\rm det}^1(r\a)/n_{\rm 
det}^{\rm tot}$.
Let the analogous quantity for secondaries be $F_2(r\a)$.
In the planet-less secondaries case ($F_2(r\a)=0$), one can 
analyze Eqs~\ref{eq:n_det_0} and~\ref{eq:n_det_1} semi-analytically and show 
that $F_1(2r_\oplus/\sqrt{2})/F_1(2r_\oplus) \approx 1.19$.
%check_companion_fractions.py, and LB's notes 2017/12/21.0
Intuitively speaking, this ``shift'' is a feature of any radius distribution 
that declines at large radii, and flattens below some cutoff $r_{\rm c}$.
This is because (for dilution about primaries)
at apparent radii $r\a < r_{\rm c}/\sqrt{2}$, relatively more planets will be 
``diluted'' into the given $r\a$, since there are more planets in 
the undiluted distribution from $r\a$ to $\sqrt{2}r\a$.
This prediction is compared against current measurements in 
Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

\subsection{Further models: radius gaps, Gaussian HJ distributions}
\label{sec:further_models}

The radius distribution specified by 
Equation~\ref{eq:model3_radius_distribution} 
misses some important features recently reported by state of the art 
occurrence rate studies.

\paragraph{Precise features of the radius valley}

\begin{figure}[!t]

        bins) as a function of planet radius in a model with a radius gap

        Other than the intrinsic radius distribution, this model has the same 
        assumptions as Figure~\protect\ref{fig:occ_rate_model_3_log}.
    }
    \label{fig:model_4}
\end{figure}

In particular,~\citet{fulton_california-_2017} reported a ``gap'' in 
the radius-period 
plane~\citep{petigura_california-kepler_2017,johnson_california-kepler_2017}.
The existence of the gap has been independently corroborated from a sample of 
KOIs with asteroseismically-determined stellar 
parameters~\citep{van_eylen_asteroseismic_2017}.
Precise measurement of the gap's features, in particular its width, 
depth, and shape, will require accurate occurrence rates.
To illustrate binarity's role in this problem, we make identical assumptions 
as in Section~\ref{sec:model_3}, but instead assume an intrinsic radius 
distribution
\begin{align}
f(r)
&\propto
\left.
\begin{cases}
r^\delta & \text{for } r\geq 2r_\oplus, \\
0 & \text{for } 1.5r_\oplus < r < 2r_\oplus, \\
{\rm constant} & \text{for } r\leq1.5r_\oplus.
\end{cases}
\right.
\label{eq:model4_radius_distribution}
\end{align}
The resulting true and inferred rates are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:model_4}.
If left uncorrected, binarity makes the gap appear more shallow, and flattens 
the step-function edges.
Of course, other effects could also ``blur'' the gap in the planet radius 
dimension. 
In particular, the valley's period-dependence is almost certainly not flat
\citep{van_eylen_asteroseismic_2017,owen_evaporation_2017}.
This means that any study measuring the gap's width or depth in the face of 
binarity must either perform tests at fixed orbital period, or else 
marginalize over period and account for the associated blurring in the planet 
radius dimension.


\paragraph{Alternative models for the HJ distribution}

In the recent study by~\citet{petigura_CKS_2017}, hot Jupiters appear as an 
island in period-radius space, rather than as a continuous component of a 
power law distribution.
This means that the apparent HJ rates computed in 
Section~\ref{sec:model_3} are probably inaccurate.
Instead, let us consider a Gaussian radius shape function,
\begin{equation}
f(r) \propto \exp \left( -\frac{(r-\bar{r})^2}{2\sigma^2} \right),
\end{equation}
with $\bar{r} = 14r_\oplus$ and $\sigma = 2r_\oplus$.
As always, $\Gamma_i(r) = Z_i f(r)$.
We then compute $\Gamma\a(r\a)$, and plot it in Figure~\ref{fig:gaussian_HJ}.
Integrating for $r\a > 8r_\oplus$ to find hot Jupiter rates,
we find the opposite effect as in the power law model.
For $Z_2/Z_0>0$, 
the apparent HJ rate is {\it greater} than the true rate for singles.
The effect is maximal when there are as many hot Jupiters orbiting secondaries 
as singles, in which case
$\Lambda_{{\rm HJ},0}/\Lambda_{\rm HJ,a} = 0.81$.
%int_rate_density_vs_radius_model_7_withtext*manyZs.pdf
For the case when no hot Jupiters orbit secondaries, $\Lambda_{{\rm HJ},0} 
\approx \Lambda_{\rm HJ,a}$ to within one percent.
Qualitatively, the apparent HJ rate can be greater than the true rate for 
singles because binary systems can have an extra star that yields 
hot Jupiter detections.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}


\paragraph{How bad is ignoring binarity?}
This study has shown that under a reasonable set of simplifying assumptions, 
ignoring binarity introduces systematic errors to star and planet counts in 
transit surveys, which then biases derived occurrence rates.
Thus far, occurrence rate calculations\footnote{
    A list of occurrence rate papers is maintained at 
    \url{https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/occurrence_rate_papers.html}
} using transit survey data have mostly ignored stellar 
multiplicity~\citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{howard_planet_2012,fressin_false_2013,foreman-mackey_exoplanet_2014,dressing_occurrence_2015,burke_terrestrial_2015}.
For {\it Kepler} occurrence rates specifically, 
it seems that no one has yet carefully assessed binarity's importance, or lack 
thereof.
Although this study does not resolve the problem, it does suggest the 
approximate scale of the possible errors in a survey-independent manner.
The suggestion of Section~\ref{sec:model_2} is that for $r\a \gtrsim 2r_\oplus$, 
binarity can be ignored down to the $\sim$few percent precision level.
For apparent radii $\lesssim 2r_\oplus$, the picture is less forgiving:
Section~\ref{sec:model_3} suggests that relative errors between apparent rates 
and true rates around singles could easily reach $\sim\! 50\%$.

\paragraph{The rate of Earth analogs}
In line with {\it Kepler}'s primary science goal, the rate of Earth-like 
planets orbiting Sun-like stars has been independently measured by 
\citet{youdin_exoplanet_2011,petigura_prevalence_2013,dong_fast_2013,
    foreman-mackey_exoplanet_2014}, and \citet{burke_terrestrial_2015}.
These efforts found that the one-year terrestrial planet occurrence rate 
is between $\approx\! 0.03$ and $\approx\!1$ per Sun-like star,
depending on assumptions that are made when calculating the
rate~\citep[see][Figure~17]{burke_terrestrial_2015}.
In Section~\ref{sec:model_3}, our power law model indicates that when 
primaries, 
singles, and secondaries host the same number of planets, the apparent rate is 
50\% higher than the true rate around single stars.
Though this bias seems large, it is currently smaller than the other 
systematic factors that dominate the dispersion in $\eta_\oplus$ 
measurements.
If future analyses determine absolute values of $\eta_\oplus$ to 
better than a factor of two, binarity will likely merit closer attention.

One caveat to this assessment of binarity's importance for 
$\eta_\oplus$ measurements is that none of our models 
included the rate density's period-dependence. However, close binaries usually
provoke dynamical instabilities, leading to fewer long-period planets per 
star~\citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{holman_long-term_1999,wang_influence_2014,
    kraus_impact_2016}.
This might affect transit survey measurements of $\eta_\oplus$ beyond our 
rough estimate.

\paragraph{Hot Jupiter rate discrepancy}
While binarity may appreciably affect $\eta_\oplus$ measurements, our analysis
suggests that it is unlikely to influence the hot Jupiter rate discrepancy.
The context of this disagreement is that hot Jupiter occurrence rates measured 
by transit surveys ($\approx 0.5\%$) are marginally lower than those found by 
radial velocity surveys ($\approx 1\%$; see Table~\ref{tab:hj_rates}).
Though the discrepancy has weak statistical significance ($<3\sigma$),
one reason to expect a difference is that the corresponding stellar 
populations have distinct metallicities.
As argued by \citet{gould_frequency_2006}, the RV sample is biased towards 
metal-rich stars, which have been measured by RV surveys to preferentially 
host more giant 
planets~\citep{santos_spectroscopic_2004,fischer_planet-metallicity_2005}.
Investigating the discrepancy from the metallicty 
angle,~\citet{guo_metallicity_2017} measured the
{\it Kepler} field's mean metallicity to be $[{\rm M/H}]_{\rm Kepler}= 
-0.045\pm0.009$, which is lower than the California Planet Search's mean of 
$[{\rm M/H}]_{\rm CPS}= -0.005\pm0.006$.
The former value agrees with that measured by \citet{dong_metallicities_2014}.
Refitting for the metallicity exponent in $\Lambda_{\rm HJ} \propto 10^{\beta 
    [{\rm M/H}] }$, \citeauthor{guo_metallicity_2017}\! found $\beta = 2.1\pm 
0.7$, and noted that this would imply that the metallicity difference could 
account for a $\approx 20\%$ relative difference in the measured rates between 
the CKS and {\it Kepler}\ samples~--~not a factor of two\footnote{
    \citet{petigura_CKS_2017} recently found $\beta = 3.4^{0.9}_{-0.8}$.
    This gives a $\approx 25\%$ relative difference, indicating metallicity 
    could 
    account for about half of the ``hot Jupiter rate discrepancy''.
}.
\citeauthor{guo_metallicity_2017}\! concluded that ``other factors, such as 
binary contamination and imperfect stellar properties'' must also be at play.

The hypothesis that binarity might matter is grounded in the fact that radial 
velocity and transit surveys treat binarity differently.
Radial velocity surveys typically reject both visual and spectroscopic binaries
\citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{wright_frequency_2012}.
Transit surveys observe binaries, but the question of whether they 
were searchable to begin with is left for later interpretation.
In spectroscopic follow-up of transiting planet candidates, the prevalence of 
astrophysical false-positives may also lead to a tendency against confirming 
transiting planets in binary systems.
A separate observational bias is that the RV surveys typically observe 
chromospherically ``quiet'' stars, which may bias their detection probability 
high~\citep{bastien_radial_2014}.

Ignoring these complications, in this work we concentrated on binarity's 
effects on star counts and the apparent radii of detected planets.
Assuming a power law radius distribution, and that no secondaries host HJs,
our results from Section~\ref{sec:model_3} indicate that binarity 
could lead to underestimated HJ rates relative to singles by a multiplicative 
factor of at most $\approx 1.13$.
We later pointed out in Section~\ref{sec:further_models} that assuming a 
power law radius distribution is probably wrong if one wishes to study the HJ 
rate discrepancy.
If we instead assumed a Gaussian radius 
distribution~\citep[following][]{petigura_CKS_2017}, apparent 
HJ rates are {\it greater} than the true rate around singles: the effect goes 
the wrong way.
\begin{comment}
If we believe the assumed power law radius distribution, we can ask whether 
this ``correction factor'' might help resolve the discrepancy.
Explicitly, we ask: what is the probability of \citet{wright_frequency_2012}'s 
result, given a rate drawn from the stated bounds of~\citet{petigura_CKS_2017}?
In other words, we first take the true HJ rate per thousand stars as 
$\Lambda_{\rm HJ} = 5.7 \pm 1.3$, with Gaussian uncertainties. 
We then draw from a Poisson distribution and compute the probability of 
detecting at least 10 hot Jupiters in a sample of 836 stars.
Without accounting for binarity or metallicity, only 4\% of RV surveys would 
detect at least 10 hot Jupiters.
If we multiply $\Lambda_{\rm HJ}$ by $1.2$ to account 
for~\citet{guo_metallicity_2017}'s measured metallicity difference between the 
{\it Kepler}\ field and the local solar neighborhood, 9\% of RV surveys would 
detect at least 10 hot Jupiters.
If we multiply once more by $1.13$ to account for binarity's supposed bias, we 
find that 14\% of RV surveys would detect at least 10 hot Jupiters, still 
suggesting a weak discrepancy.

This suggestion should be taken with caution, because it (likely incorrectly) 
assumes a power law radius distribution.
\end{comment}
The ``hot Jupiter island'' reported by~\citet{petigura_CKS_2017} cannot 
possibly be part of a continuous power law. 
Thus binarity is unlikely to resolve the HJ rate discrepancy.

Of course, such calculations are only suggestive; a conclusive resolution 
of binarity's effects may require a detailed understanding of the 
{\it Kepler}\ field's multiplicity statistics, and the mission's completeness 
(both for candidate detection and follow-up).
For instance, if hot Jupiters are less likely to be confirmed in binary 
systems, this might bias the rates low.
Alternatively, {\it TESS}\ is expected to discover over $10^4$ 
giant planets~\citep{ricker_transiting_2014,sullivan_transiting_2015}.
Though they will be difficult to distinguish from false positives, one 
possible use of this sample will be to measure an occurrence rate of 
short-period giant planets with minimal error from counting statistics.
Our models suggest that binarity will only become an appreciable fraction of 
the error budget at the $\approx 10\%$ precision level.
This should be sufficient for a rate measurement precise enough to indicate a 
preference between $\approx 0.5\%$ and $\approx 1\%$ of Sun-like stars hosting 
hot Jupiters.



\paragraph{Practical effects: smooth detection efficiencies; finite SNR floors}
To apply this study to real transit surveys, a few practical concerns become 
pressing.
One concern is that space-based missions with telemetric requirements
are often required to select target stars.
Even if the selection process is aimed at creating an SNR-limited
survey, as~\citet{batalha_selection_2010} did for {\it Kepler},
uncertainties in stellar parameters and the modeled instrument performance
can lead to deviations away from an SNR-limited stellar sample.

Further, in most transit surveys the detection efficiency is not
a step function in SNR.
Transit survey pipeline detection efficiencies are usually smooth
functions in SNR; see for example the injection-recovery 
simulations 
performed by~\citet{christiansen_measuring_2016} on {\it Kepler}\ data, 
and the resulting smooth detection efficiency adopted 
by~\citet{fulton_california-_2017}.
If we were to assume a smooth detection probability in SNR, we would need to 
include a detection efficiency term in 
Equation~\ref{eq:apparent_rate_density} to inversely weight for planets 
with low probabilities of being detected.

The simplest way to avoid the conceptual complications of accounting for 
finite detection efficiency is to raise the SNR floor, to {\it e.g.,} 
${\rm SNR} \approx 12$ for {\it Kepler} 
(\citealt{fulton_california-_2017}, Figure~5).
To a good approximation, this allows one to use the boolean distinctions 
``searchable'' and ``not searchable'' for signals of an observed depth (at 
fixed orbital period).
By making the survey strictly SNR-limited, rather than ``fuzzily 
SNR-limited'', binarity's effects become much easier to model.
Since the minimum SNR for detection is set in an arbitrary manner 
anyway\footnote{For example, {\it Kepler}'s threshold of ${\rm SNR}=7.1$ was 
set for there to be no more than one statistical false alarm across the full 
{\it Kepler} campaign~\citep{jenkins_tests_2002}. Equally valid would have 
been to insist on no more than $10^{-3}$ false alarms per survey, raising the 
detection floor.
}, this simplification would put occurrence rate studies on 
clearer conceptual 
ground, and facilitate the process of converting the observed distributions
of apparent radii into true radius distributions.

Finally, our calculations also ignore the fact that any given transit 
survey's finite SNR floor might censor the apparent rate density.
If the surveyed stars all have the same size, this is equivalent to 
saying that there might be a cutoff in apparent planet radii, below which no 
planets are detected.
The effects on our main results (e.g., 
Figs.~\ref{fig:occ_rate_model_3_log},~\ref{fig:frac_model_3}, 
and~\ref{fig:gaussian_HJ}) would be that the apparent rate density 
below the cutoff in apparent radius would simply drop to zero.




\begin{comment}
If one insists on using a smooth detection efficiency, then life probably 
becomes more complicated.
It might then be necessary to model the detection pipeline's efficiency while 
somehow marginalizing over binarity.
Since the relative number of detections (at fixed $\delta_{\rm obs}$) coming 
from singles, primaries, and secondaries changes as a function of the 
intrinsic distribution of planet parameters (Figure~\ref{fig:frac_model_3}), 
some complicated deconvolution might be required.
\end{comment}





\paragraph{Connecting high resolution imaging to occurrence rates}
A direct reason to address stellar multiplicity in transit surveys is that it 
changes the interpretation of planet candidates on a system-by-system level.
Consequently, high resolution imaging 
campaigns have measured the multiplicities of almost all {\it Kepler}\ Objects 
of Interest 
\citep{howell_speckle_2011,adams_adaptive_2012,adams_adaptive_2013,horch_observations_2012,
    horch_most_2014,lillo-box_multiplicity_2012,lillo-box_high-resolution_2014,dressing_adaptive_2014,
    law_robotic_2014,cartier_revision_2015,everett_high-resolution_2015,gilliland_hubble_2015,
    wang_influence_2015,wang_influence_2015-1,baranec_robo-ao_2016,ziegler_robo-ao_2017}.
The results of these programs have been collected 
by~\citet{furlan_kepler_2017}, and they represent an important advance in 
understanding the KOI 
sample's multiplicity statistics.
In particular, they can be immediately applied to rectify binarity's effects 
on the mass-radius diagram~\citep{furlan_densities_2017}.

These high resolution imaging campaigns are also beginning to connect with
occurrence rate calculations.
The most recent rate studies have used~\citet{furlan_kepler_2017}'s 
catalog to test the effects of removing KOI hosts with known companions, which 
helps reduce contamination in the ``numerator'' of 
the occurrence rate (\citealt{fulton_california-_2017}; 
\citealt{petigura_CKS_2017}).
However, without an understanding of the multiplicity statistics of the 
non-KOI stars, the true number of searchable stars, and thus the true 
occurrence rates, will remain biased.

\paragraph{Does a detected planet orbit the primary or secondary?}
One important step towards rectifying binarity's effects is identifying the 
host star for any detected planets in binaries.
The current 
wisdom is that nothing substantive can be said about the 
likelihood of a planet orbiting the primary vs. the 
secondary~\citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{ciardi_understanding_2015,ziegler_robo-ao_2017}.
This of course ignores cases when planets can be confirmed to orbit either 
component by analyzing the transit durations or centroids.

\begin{comment}
\citet{ciardi_understanding_2015} studied the effects of stellar multiplicity 
on the planet radii derived from transit surveys.
They modeled the problem for {\it Kepler}\ objects of interest by matching a 
population of binary and tertiary companions to KOI stars, 
under the assumption that the KIC-listed stars were the primaries.
They then computed planet radius correction factors assuming that {\it 
    Kepler}-detected planets orbited the primary or companion stars
with equal probability (their Section~5).
Under these assumptions, they found that any given planet's radius is on 
average underestimated by a multiplicative factor of $\approx\! 1.5$.
\citet{ziegler_robo-ao_2017} recently reported a similar mean radius 
correction factor for the multiple systems observed by the Robo-AO KOI survey, 
using the same assumption that detected planets are as likely to orbit the 
primary and the secondary.
\end{comment}

Assuming a broken power law radius distribution, we showed in 
Figure~\ref{fig:frac_model_3} that there are many cases where a detected 
planet 
is much more likely to orbit the primary.
A planet orbiting the secondary does lead to extreme corrections.
However, at $r\a \gtrsim 2r_\oplus$, these cases are rare outliers.
At $r_\oplus \lesssim r\a \lesssim 2r_\oplus$, for all of the trial values of 
$Z_2/Z_0$ assumed in Figure~\ref{fig:frac_model_3}, a detected planet is 
always 
more likely to orbit the primary than the secondary.
Only at very small apparent radii, $r\a \approx 0.5r_\oplus$, and only if 
secondaries host as many planets as singles and primaries, does this ``rule'' 
break down.

Of course, our model's assumptions (see the list in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}) 
might not apply to the {\it Kepler}\ dataset.
However if they are applicable, then for the $56\%$ of ``\texttt{CONFIRMED}'' 
KOIs\footnote{Exoplanet Archive; \cite{akeson_nasa_2013}; 
    \url{exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu}} with 
apparent radii $>2r_\oplus$, 
whenever high-resolution imaging 
discovers a binary companion in 
a system that hosts a detected transiting planet, the planet is much
more likely to orbit the primary.


\paragraph{Fraction of detected planets with binary companions vs. apparent 
radius}
One further prediction of Figure~\ref{fig:frac_model_3} is that the fraction 
of 
detected planets with binary companions increases by $\approx 6-12\%$ going 
from $2r_\oplus$ to $\approx\! 1.4r_\oplus$.
In \citet{ziegler_robo-ao_2017}'s recent summary of the Robo-AO KOI survey, 
they reported the fraction of planet-hosting stars with Robo-AO detected 
companion stars, binning by Earths ($r\a < 1.6r_\oplus$), Neptunes 
($1.6r_\oplus < r\a < 3.9 r_\oplus$), Saturns ($3.9r_\oplus < r\a < 9 
r_\oplus$), and Jupiters ($r\a > 9r_\oplus$).
The reported nearby star rates and their $1\sigma$ uncertainties are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Earths: $16.3 \pm 1.0\%$, from 1480 systems.
    \item Neptunes: $13.0 \pm 0.8\%$, from 2058 systems.
    \item Saturns: $13.6 \pm 2.0\%$, from 338 systems.
    \item Jupiters: $19.0 \pm 2.8\%$, from 247 systems.
\end{itemize} 
where the uncertainties were calculated 
following~\citet{burgasser_binarity_2003}.
The absolute values of the rates are less than the $\sim\! 45\%$ typical for 
Sun-like stars at least in part because of Robo-AO's sensitivity 
(\citealt{ziegler_robo-ao_2017}'s Figure~2;~\citealt{raghavan_survey_2010}).
Another reason for the lower measured companion rates could be that planetary 
systems are less likely to have 
binary companions (as~\citealt{kraus_impact_2016} argued for close binary 
companions).
The uptick in the companion rate for Jupiters is likely tied to a large 
astrophysical false positive rate~\citep{santerne_sophie_2012}.
Going from Neptunes to Earths, the data suggest a weak increase in the 
detected planet companion fraction, perhaps of a few percent.
It will be interesting to see whether this effect is borne out by further 
observations.




\begin{comment}
\paragraph{Independent approaches for estimating binarity's effects}
T. Barclay et al.\! (in preparation) have performed the exercise of taking 
stars selected by the {\it Kepler}\ team, pairing them with a population of 
secondaries, injecting a realistic distribution of planet radii, 
and then comparing the inferred occurrence rates with the true ones.
In their model, they find that binarity leads to an inferred rate of 
Earth-sized planets $\approx 10\%$ less than the true rate.
In our Model \#3, if all $Z_i$'s are equal (a plausible assumption in 
the lack of evidence to the contrary), the underestimate is by a comparable 
16\%.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This study presented simple models for how binarity affects occurrence 
rates measured by transit surveys.
The simplest of these models (Section~\ref{sec:simplest}) provided an 
order-of-magnitude estimate that suggested we would need implausibly high twin 
binary fractions for binarity to affect apparent occurrence rates by more than 
factors of two.

We then derived a general formula for the apparent rate density inferred by an 
observer ignoring binarity (Equation~\ref{eq:general_Gamma_a}).
As input, this equation requires a volume-limited mass ratio distribution 
$f(q)$, and the true rate densities for planets around singles, 
primaries, and secondaries.
The assumptions that make the model tractable are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the transit survey is SNR-limited;
    \item the true properties of all the singles and primaries are known to 
    the observer;
    \item the observers assume that binaries have the same properties as the 
    primaries;
    \item there are functions $L(M)$ and $R(M)$ that specify a star's 
    luminosity and radius in terms of its mass.
\end{enumerate}
Allowing for these conditions, many results follow:
\begin{itemize}
%
\item Assuming a power law planet radius distribution, and that the same 
number of planets orbit singles, primaries, and secondaries, binarity 
influences apparent planet occurrence rates around Sun-like stars at the 
$\sim$few percent level from radii $2r_\oplus \lesssim r\a \lesssim 
17r_\oplus$ (Section~\ref{sec:model_2}).
%
\item Assuming a broken-power law planet radius distribution, with 
\citet{howard_planet_2012}'s exponent at $r > 2r_\oplus$ and a constant 
occurrence at $r < 2r_\oplus$, there is a ``bump'' in the apparent rate 
density at $r\a < 2r_\oplus$, leading to a relative error $\delta \Gamma_0 = 
|\Gamma_0 - \Gamma\a|/\Gamma_0$ of at most $\approx 50\%$ 
(Figure~\ref{fig:occ_rate_model_3_log}).
Although this is smaller than current systematic uncertainties on the 
occurrence rates of Earth-sized planets, this means that binarity could
eventually become an important component of the $\eta_\oplus$ error budget.
%
\item Binarity ``fills in'' gaps in the radius distribution 
(Figure~\ref{fig:model_4}), by an amount that could affect precise 
measurements 
of the depth, width, and slope of \citet{fulton_california-_2017}'s radius 
gap, in the event that planets are not carefully vetted with high resolution 
imaging.
%
\item Binarity does not lead to smaller apparent HJ occurrence rates 
(Figure~\ref{fig:gaussian_HJ}).
This assumes a Gaussian planet radius distribution, similar to that reported 
by~\citet{petigura_CKS_2017}.
%
\item Detected planets with $r\a \gtrsim 0.5r_\oplus$ that are revealed by 
high resolution imaging surveys to exist in binaries are more likely to orbit 
the primary (Figure~\ref{fig:frac_model_3}).
%
\item Near the ``break'' in the rate distribution ($\approx 2r_\oplus$), 
the fraction of detected planets with binary companions increases by 
$\approx 5-10\%$ (Figure~\ref{fig:frac_model_3}).
\end{itemize}

All of these results should be understood as only being strictly applicable 
when the assumptions listed above are met.
Otherwise, while it is only suggestive, our approach still provides 
helpful hints at how ignoring stellar binarity influences transit survey
occurrence rates.

\appendix
\section{Derivation of general formula for apparent occurrence rate}
\label{sec:appendix}

In this appendix, we derive Equation~\ref{eq:general_Gamma_a}.
First, recall our definition of apparent rate density 
(Equation~\ref{eq:apparent_rate_density}).
We assume that $R$ and $L$ are uniquely determined from the assumed 
stellar mass--radius--luminosity relation, and neglect the dependence on 
planetary orbital period.
The planets with $(r\a, M\a)$ are associated with 
systems of many different planetary and stellar properties, so $n_{\rm 
det}(r\a, M\a)$ is given by the convolution of the true rate density, 
$\Gamma(r, M)$, and $\mathcal{N}_\star(r\a, M\a; r, M)$, the number (per 
unit $(r\a, M\a)$) of searchable stars that give $(r\a, M\a)$  when 
the true system actually has $(r, M)$. Mathematically,
\begin{align}
n_{\rm det}(r\a, M\a) &=
\sum_i n_{\rm det}^i(r\a, M\a) \\
&=
\sum_i \int \mathrm{d}r \mathrm{d}M \,
\mathcal{N}_\star^i(r\a,M\a; r,M)
\cdot\Gamma_i(r,M) \cdot p_{\rm tra}(r,M),
\label{eq:n_det}
\end{align}
where $i$ specifies the type of true host stars (0: single, 1: primary, 2: 
secondary).
The problem reduces to the evaluation of
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{N}_\star^i(\pp\a,\ps\a; \pp, \ps)
\end{equation}
for planets around single stars, primaries in binaries, and secondaries in 
binaries. 

\paragraph{Single stars} For $i=0$, 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{N}_\star^0(r\a,M\a; r,M)
=\delta(r\a-r)\delta(M\a-M) N_\star^0(r,M),
\end{equation}
so
\begin{equation}
n_{\rm det}^0(r\a, M\a)=N_\star^0(r\a,M\a)\cdot \Gamma_0(r\a, 
M\a) \cdot p_{\rm tra}(r\a, M\a).
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Primaries in binaries}
The number of primaries with apparent parameters $(r\a,M\a)$ given the 
true parameters $(r,M)$ is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{N}_\star^1(r\a, M\a; r, M)
=\int \mathrm{d}q\,f(q)\mathcal{N}_{{\rm s}, q}^1(r\a, M\a, q; r, M),
\label{eq:fancyN_s_1}
\end{equation}
where $f(q)$ is the volume-limited binary mass ratio distribution.

Since we assume $\ps\a=\ps_1$,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{N}_{{\rm s},q}^1(r\a, M\a, q; r, M) \propto \delta(M\a-M).
\end{equation}
In this case, $\mathcal{N}_{{\rm s},q}^1$ is non-zero only at 
$r\a=R_a\sqrt{\delta_{\rm obs}}$, 
and the observed depth is
\begin{equation}
\delta_{\rm obs}
= \left[{r\over R(M\a)}\right]^2\times {L(M\a) \over L_{\rm sys}(M\a, q)}
\equiv \left[{r\over R(M\a)}\right]^2\times \mathcal{A}(q,M\a)^2,
\label{eq:delta_obs_primaries} 
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A}(q, M\a)=\sqrt{L(M\a) \over L_{\rm sys}(M\a, q)}.
\end{equation}
The normalization of $\mathcal{N}_{{\rm s},q}^1$ is given by the number of 
binaries that are searchable for a signal $\delta_{\rm obs}$ and that have the 
mass ratio $q$:
\begin{equation}
N_\star^0(\delta_{\rm obs}, 
L(M\a))\cdot
{n\b\over n\s}\left[L_{\rm sys}(M\a, q) \over L(M\a)\right]^{3/2}
=N_\star^0(\delta_{\rm obs}, L(M\a))
\cdot \frac{{\rm BF}}{1 - {\rm BF}} \cdot {1 \over \mathcal{A}(q,M\a)^3}.
\label{eq:primary_normalization}
\end{equation}
Thus,
\begin{align}
\notag
\mathcal{N}_{{\rm s}, q}^1(r\a, M\a, q; r, M)
&=N_\star^0(\delta_{\rm obs}, L(M\a))
\cdot \frac{{\rm BF}}{1 - {\rm BF}} \cdot {1 \over \mathcal{A}(q,M\a)^3}\\
&\times\delta \left[r\a-r\mathcal{A}(q,M\a)\right]\delta(M\a-M).
\label{eq:N_s_1}
\end{align}


\paragraph{Secondaries in binaries}
In this case, $M=qM_1=qM\a$, so
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{N}_{{\rm s},q}^2(r\a, M\a, q; r, M)
\propto \delta\left(M\a-{M\over q}\right).
\label{eq:fancyN_s_2_prop}
\end{equation}
Again $\mathcal{N}_\star^2$ is non-zero only at $r\a=R_a\sqrt{\delta_{\rm 
        obs}}$, but this 
time
\begin{equation}
\delta_{\rm obs} = \left[{r\over R(qM\a)}\right]^2 \times {L(qM\a) 
    \over L_{\rm sys}(M\a, q)}
    \equiv \left[{r\over R(M\a)}\right]^2\times \mathcal{B}(q,M\a)^2,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{B}(q, M\a)={R(M\a)\over R(qM\a)}\sqrt{{L(qM\a) \over L_{\rm 
            sys}(M\a, q)} }.
\end{equation}
The normalization remains the same as the previous case (we are counting the 
searchable stars at a given observed depth $\delta_{\rm obs}$, and the total 
luminosity of the binary is the same).
Thus,
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{N}_\star^2(r\a, M\a; r, M)
=\int \mathrm{d}q\,f(q)\mathcal{N}_{{\rm s}, q}^2(r\a, M\a, q; r, M),
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
\notag
\mathcal{N}_{{\rm s},q}^2(r\a, M\a, q; r, M)
&=N_\star^0(\delta_{\rm obs}, L(M\a)) \cdot \frac{{\rm BF}}{1 - {\rm BF}} 
\cdot {1 \over \mathcal{A}(q,M\a)^3}\\
&\times 
	\delta \left[r\a-r\mathcal{B}(q,M\a)\right]
	\delta\left(M\a-{M\over q}\right).
\label{eq:mathcal_N_s_2}
\end{align}

One might worry in Equation~\ref{eq:mathcal_N_s_2} that we opt to write 
$\mathcal{N}\s^2 \propto \delta(M\a - M/q)$, rather than $\propto \delta(M\a q 
- M)$ or some other delta function with the same functional dependence, 
but a different normalization once integrated.
We do this because the delta function in Equation~\ref{eq:mathcal_N_s_2} is 
defined with respect to the measure ${\rm d}M\a$, not ${\rm d}M$.
This is because $\mathcal{N}\s^2$ is defined as a number per $r\a$, per $M\a$.

\paragraph{Number of detected planets}
Marginalizing per Equation~\ref{eq:n_det}, we find
\begin{align}
\notag
n_{\rm det}^0(r\a, M\a)
&=\int\mathrm{d}r\mathrm{d}M\,\mathcal{N}_\star^0(r\a, M\a; r, M)
\cdot\Gamma_0(r, M) \cdot p_{\rm tra}(M)\\
&=N_\star^0(\delta_{\rm obs}, L(M\a))\cdot\Gamma_0(r\a, M\a) \cdot p_{\rm 
    tra}(M\a),
\label{eq:n_det_0}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\notag
n_{\rm det}^1(r\a, M\a)
&=\int\mathrm{d}r\mathrm{d}M\,\mathcal{N}_\star^1(r\a, M\a; r, M)
\cdot\Gamma_1(r, M) \cdot p_{\rm tra}(M)\\
&=N_\star^0(\delta_{\rm obs}, L(M\a))\cdot p_{\rm tra}(M\a) \cdot
{\mathrm{BF}\over{1-\mathrm{BF}}} \int {\mathrm{d}q \over 
    \mathcal{A}^4}\,f(q)\,\Gamma_1\left({r\a\over\mathcal{A}}, M\a\right).
\label{eq:n_det_1}
\end{align}
Finally,
\begin{align}
n_{\rm det}^2(r\a, M\a)
\notag
&=\int\mathrm{d}r\mathrm{d}M\,\mathcal{N}_\star^2(r\a, M\a; r, M)
\cdot\Gamma_2(r, M) \cdot p_{\rm tra}(M)\\
&=
N_\star^0(\delta_{\rm obs}, L(M\a))\cdot \frac{{\rm BF}}{1 - {\rm BF}}
\int {q \mathrm{d}q \over 
{\mathcal{A}^3\mathcal{B}}}\,f(q)\,\Gamma_2\left({r\a\over\mathcal{B}}, 
qM\a\right)\,p_{\rm 
    tra}(qM\a).
\label{eq:n_det_2}
\end{align}


\paragraph{General formula for apparent occurrence rate}
Using the above results, the apparent rate density,
\begin{align}
\Gamma\a(r\a,M\a) &= 
\frac{1}{N_\star(r\a,M\a) p_{\rm tra}(r\a,M\a)} \times
\sum_i n_{\rm det}^i (r\a,M\a),
\end{align}
evaluates to

\begin{align}
\notag
\Gamma\a(r\a,M\a) &= {1\over 1+\mu(\mathrm{BF}, M\a)}\times
\left\{ \Gamma_0(r\a, M\a)+ 
\frac{{\rm BF}}{1 - {\rm BF}}
\left[ \int {\mathrm{d}q \over \mathcal{A}^4}\,f(q)\,\Gamma_1\left({r\a\over 
    \mathcal{A}}, 
M\a\right)\,
\right.   
\right. \\
& \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \left.\left.
+\int {q \mathrm{d}q \over 
    {\mathcal{A}^3\mathcal{B}}}\,f(q)\,\Gamma_2\left({r\a\over 
    \mathcal{B}}, 
qM\a\right)\,
{R(qM\a) \over R(M\a)}
q^{-1/3} \right]	\right\}.
\label{eq:final_formula}
\end{align}
This equation is used to derive Eqs.~\ref{eq:model5_apparent_rate_density} 
and~\ref{eq:powerlaw_vary_binary}, and is numerically integrated to create 
Figs.~\ref{fig:occ_rate_model_3_log},~\ref{fig:model_4}, 
and~\ref{fig:gaussian_HJ}.
It is validated in limits in which it is possible to write down the answer 
(e.g., Equation~\ref{eq:model_1_apparent_rate_density}), and also against a 
Monte 
Carlo realization of the twin binary models (Secs.~\ref{sec:model_1} 
and~\ref{sec:model_2}).

Noting the definition of $\mu$ in Equation~\ref{eq:mu_general},
Equation~\ref{eq:final_formula} can also be expressed as
\begin{align}
\notag
\notag
\Gamma\a(r\a,M\a) &= {1\over 1+\mu(\mathrm{BF}, M\a)} \cdot
   \left[ \Gamma_0(r\a, M\a)\phantom{\tilde \Gamma}\right.&\\
   &\left.+\mu(\mathrm{BF}, M\a)\cdot
   %\tilde\Gamma_1(r\a, M\a)
   \left\langle {1 \over \mathcal{A}}\cdot\Gamma_1\left({r\a\over\mathcal{A}}, M\a\right)
   +%\tilde\Gamma_2(r\a, M\a)
   {q \over \mathcal{B}}\cdot\Gamma_2\left({r\a\over\mathcal{B}}, qM\a\right) \cdot {R(qM\a) \over R(M\a)}q^{-1/3}\right\rangle
   \right],
\end{align}
where the angle brackets denote averaging over $f(q)/\mathcal{A}^3$. This form
shows that the fraction $\mu$ and mass ratio distribution 
$f(q)/\mathcal{A}^3$ of binaries {\it in the searchable volume} are enough to 
describe the contributions from binaries to $\Gamma\a$.
The fraction $\mu$ gives the relative contributions from singles and binaries,
and $f(q)/\mathcal{A}^3$ weights the contributions from binaries with various 
mass ratios.
The apparent rate density at each mass ratio ({\it i.e.}, the terms in
the angle brackets) is the rate density of systems that give the apparent
$(r\a, M\a)$, corrected for the overestimated transit probability around
secondaries.
